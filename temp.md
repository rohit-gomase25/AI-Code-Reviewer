❌ Bad Code:
```javascript
function sum(){return a+b;}
```

🔍 Issues:
* ❌ The variables `a` and `b` are not defined within the function scope. This will likely lead to errors or unexpected
behavior because the function will look for `a` and `b` in the global scope (which is generally bad practice).
* ❌ The function doesn't take any arguments, meaning it can't be used flexibly to sum different numbers.

✅ Recommended Fix:

```javascript
function sum(a, b) {
return a + b;
}
```

💡 Improvements:
* ✔️ The function now accepts `a` and `b` as parameters, making it reusable with different inputs.
* ✔️ The scope of `a` and `b` is limited to the function, avoiding potential naming conflicts and making the code more
predictable.

Additional Notes:

* Consider adding input validation to ensure that `a` and `b` are numbers. If they are not numbers, you could throw an
error or return a specific value.
* You can also add JSDoc style comments to indicate parameter types and return value for better readability and tooling
support.
